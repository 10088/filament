**Filament glTF Ecosystem**

![](images/filament_logo.png width=150px)

-----

The core Filament renderer is developed in tandem with a set of auxiliary libraries that can load
and animate glTF assets, in both **gltf** and **glb** file formats. 

- Much like Filament itself, Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms are all
  supported, using any of our backends (Metal, Vulkan, and OpenGL / WebGL).
- For Android and Web platforms, we provide platform-specific viewer helpers that make the library
  especially easy to use.
- On Android and iOS, we provide a remote control interface whereby an asset can be dragged into a
  web page, and various settings can be toggled via the user interface.
- For all desktop platforms, we provide a gltf_viewer application that sports the same UI as the
  remote control interface.
- Two modes for material management are supported, **ubershader mode** and **generator mode**.
  The former allows for fast loading but at the cost of increased shader complexity. The latter
  involves run-time compilation and therefore has dependencies on additional libraries such as
  glslang and spirv-tools. (By default, our Android and Web builds support ubershader mode only;
  they do not include generator functionality.)
- Ubershader mode can be built in a "lite" configuration which supports fewer features but has
  a much smaller footprint.
- Clients can also provide their custom *material provider* if neither the ubershader or generator
  modes suit their needs.

# Limitations

Filament's glTF libraries are not suitable for clients that require the ability to perform
fine-grained manipulation of live scene graphs (e.g. 3D modeling software). However they are a good
fit for generic model viewers or applications that need simple loading and animation functionality.

Our glTF libraries have a high level of conformance, with a few exceptions, such as:

- Some rarely used primitive types are not supported (line loops and strips, triangle fans and
  strips).
- For morph animation, up to 255 morph targets are supported, but only the four most influential
  targets are honored at any given time slice.
- Filament can use only a limited number of texture samplers. If several glTF extensions are used
  simultaneously, these limits can cause some texture layers to be dropped.

See the [feature list](#featurelist) section for more details.

# Layers

On Android, the glTF ecosystem is comprised of the middle two layers in the following diagram.
The gray boxes are hidden from clients who choose to use *ModelViewer*, our high level asset viewing
utility for Java and Kotlin clients.

For browser-based clients, we provide an experimental
[web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) called **FilamentViewer**. This supports
a one-line loading functionality, as in:

```html
<filament-viewer src="https://prideout.net/models/CesiumMan.glb" ibl="kansas.ktx" />
```

Additionally, **FilamentViewer** supports drag-and-drop and animation.

More generally, on all platforms, the **gltfio** library is comprised of the following pieces.
